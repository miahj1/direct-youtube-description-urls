# Direct YouTube Description URLs
I’ve wanted to share a specific link from a YouTube description, and it’s a heavy, confusing, and ugly url. Effectively, forcing me to drag the insertion cursor over the text which is time consuming. The script fixes these issues, changing those pesky URLs in descriptions of YouTube videos to their more beautiful and direct versions.
